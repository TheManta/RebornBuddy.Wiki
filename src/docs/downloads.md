## ☑️ Automatic Installation and Updates

[RepoBuddy](https://github.com/Zimgineering/repoBuddy) is **the recommended way to install and update RebornBuddy add-ons**. Don't stress over unblocking `.zip` files, extracting to the right locations, or staying up to date -- just install RepoBuddy and let it do the work!

Almost all useful add-ons are included with RepoBuddy by default, so you probably won't need the list below after installing it. Updates occur each time RebornBuddy starts.

Just be sure to enable RepoBuddy in RebornBuddy's Plugins tab, open RepoBuddy's settings to install Lisbeth and Magitek from the One-Time Downloads tab, then click "Restart RebornBuddy" at the top of the menu.
